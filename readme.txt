Player Application:

-For the player application, we have three different types of mode and 15 levels, going in the order of Puzzle, Lightning, Theme.

 pressing the back button will save your Stars and Score.

-When playing the game, you choose words on the Board as you would in Boggle, by clicking to the letter squares to form words and click

-When you have at least 1 Star, a “Skip” button will appear and you can click “Skip” to move on to the next level. You also have the 
option to continue to play the game and achieve more Stars.
